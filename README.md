Hi my name is Matthias.
I am a new to coding and programming. 
I am learning python and this is my fourth week. 
I got an exercise to write a BlackJack program. 
And so here it is. I am open to comments and opinions, so i can learn from them. 
I haven't covered all the topics of python yet and i used what i know so far.

Thank you for checking it out and leaving a review. This really helps me learn and get better in programming.
